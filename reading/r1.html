        Hey Dan!

Do you say ‘b*tch’ when you actually want to say ‘beach’? 😳

Do you pronounce letters that should be silent (like receipt, doubt, climb)? 🫣<br />

<p>
It’s incredibly frustrating and embarrassing, right?<br />

These problems affect so many people, even those who’ve been learning English for years.<br />

<br /></p>
<p>
The problem is that these kinds of mistakes can lead to other people misunderstanding you (or worse – asking you the dreaded question “What? Can you repeat that, please?”).

So, let me now ask you…
​<br /></p>
<p>

Do people often misunderstand you and think you’re saying something completely different?<br />
​
Are English sounds difficult for you to say so you get tongue-tied, make mistakes, and feel anxious and embarrassed when speaking?<br />
​
Do you feel people judge you and this is stopping you from feeling your most confident self when you speak English?<br />
​</p>
<p>
If you’re nodding your head while reading any of these, then it’s a good indication that you should be working on your pronunciation.<br />
​
And if you don’t tackle these issues now, they’re going to continue affecting your confidence and holding you back in life.<br />
​
You’re going to continue missing out on having meaningful and fluent conversations, landing that perfect job, and studying at your dream university.<br />
​
​The good news is you CAN do something about this – and no, it doesn’t have to take years of practice to see results!<br />
​</p>
<p>
In fact, with the right habits, you could start seeing improvements in just one or two lessons (more on that soon).<br />
​
In my next email (tomorrow), I’m going to tell you Miriam's story.<br />
​
Despite her excellent writing and grammar, Miriam faced a significant challenge that held her back from applying to her dream engineering jobs – her English pronunciation.<br />
​
Her nerves would get the better of her in interviews, resulting in her panicking, getting tongue-tied, and speaking too fast for the interviewer.<br />
​
So, Miriam came to me to help her fix this. And a few months later she landed her dream job!<br />
​</p>
<p>
But… something very strange happened…<br />
​
Look out for my next email tomorrow “😬 I couldn’t believe my student did this…” and you’ll learn what happened to Miriam.<br />
​
</p>
<p>
Make sure you read it, because I’ll also reveal a powerful trick to quickly improve your pronunciation so you can start speaking English more clearly (it’s exactly what I taught Miriam! 🤫).<br />
