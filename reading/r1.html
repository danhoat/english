Hey Dan!

Do you say ‘b*tch’ when you actually want to say ‘beach’? 😳

Do you pronounce letters that should be silent (like receipt, doubt, climb)? 🫣

It’s incredibly frustrating and embarrassing, right?

These problems affect so many people, even those who’ve been learning English for years.

The problem is that these kinds of mistakes can lead to other people misunderstanding you (or worse – asking you the dreaded question “What? Can you repeat that, please?”).

So, let me now ask you…
​

Do people often misunderstand you and think you’re saying something completely different?
​
Are English sounds difficult for you to say so you get tongue-tied, make mistakes, and feel anxious and embarrassed when speaking?
​
Do you feel people judge you and this is stopping you from feeling your most confident self when you speak English?
​
If you’re nodding your head while reading any of these, then it’s a good indication that you should be working on your pronunciation.
​
And if you don’t tackle these issues now, they’re going to continue affecting your confidence and holding you back in life.
​
You’re going to continue missing out on having meaningful and fluent conversations, landing that perfect job, and studying at your dream university.
​
​The good news is you CAN do something about this – and no, it doesn’t have to take years of practice to see results!
​
In fact, with the right habits, you could start seeing improvements in just one or two lessons (more on that soon).
​
In my next email (tomorrow), I’m going to tell you Miriam's story.
​
Despite her excellent writing and grammar, Miriam faced a significant challenge that held her back from applying to her dream engineering jobs – her English pronunciation.
​
Her nerves would get the better of her in interviews, resulting in her panicking, getting tongue-tied, and speaking too fast for the interviewer.
​
So, Miriam came to me to help her fix this. And a few months later she landed her dream job!
​
But… something very strange happened…
​
Look out for my next email tomorrow “😬 I couldn’t believe my student did this…” and you’ll learn what happened to Miriam.
​
Make sure you read it, because I’ll also reveal a powerful trick to quickly improve your pronunciation so you can start speaking English more clearly (it’s exactly what I taught Miriam! 🤫).
