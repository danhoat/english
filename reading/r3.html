        Hassan and Walid are brother. They live in a small house in the desert, near the mountains, a long way from a town or village. <br /> They’re very poor. They have no money and they have no animals. Their house only has two rooms. 

        Every day is the same. <br /> They get up,and they have sweet black coffee for breakfast. <br /> 
        Then Hassan Works in the fields – but Walid just sits and looks at the hot, empty desert and the hot, empty sky. <br /> 
        They live with their mother. She takes care of them, butshe’s old and tired.One day she says, “We’re poor and hungry.<br /> 

        Why don’t you leave here and find work? We need money for food and clothes”. 

        “If you want some money, you have your silver ring – you can sell that”, answers Walid.“I can’t sell it”, she says.
         “It’s your father’s. Every night I look at it and remember him”.Hassan wants to help his mother, and he decides to leave home.
        His mother gives him bread, and water in a glass bottle.He kisses her, and he walks towards the mountains.
