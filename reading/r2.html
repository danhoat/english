        4 tactics to fuel a growth mindset and expand your potential
Author: Beyondsoft Recruiting

Do you believe intelligence, talent, and other personal attributes are innate, fixed qualities? Or can hard work plus an appetite for learning improve performance?

How you answer these questions marks the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset—a distinction that can influence the trajectory of your career. To summarize, a growth mindset is the conviction that one’s talent, skills, and intelligence can be increased through time and effort. A fixed mindset is the belief that such attributes are innate and cannot be changed.

Put the power of a growth mindset in your corner with these four tactics. Ready to exercise your growth mindset in a new role? Check out the latest career opportunities at Beyondsoft, listed below.

1. Embrace the power of yet
Just because you don’t learn something quickly doesn’t mean it can’t be learned. In fact, mastering a new skill can be a struggle, requiring persistent effort and resilience. A person with a fixed mindset might say, “I don’t know that,” and give up. But a person with a growth mindset will say, “I don’t know that…yet,” and press on, believing in their ability to learn. That’s the power of yet.

2. Challenge yourself to reach beyond your limits
When you hit the breaking point of your personal limits, your mindset determines whether you push harder or give up. Learning to view challenges as opportunities to grow rather than roadblocks is essential to expanding your potential. Personal growth requires pushing past your comfort zone regularly. Seek out challenges that expose you to the risk of failure, and realize that if you never fail, you’re probably not challenging yourself. In fact, some of the world’s most successful people use failure as a springboard to success.

3. Become a lifetime learner
Fuel a growth mindset by integrating learning into your lifestyle. Start with your goals and go from there. Interested in taking on a more challenging role or making a career shift? Look at the skills required for the job you want and create a plan. Talk to your manager about training opportunities or stretch projects. Find and take an online course in your spare time. You can even dive into a side project.

And let’s not forget about books. Turns out that 85% of successful people read at least two educational books every month. In fact, Bill Gates reads a book every week.

4. Be open to feedback
Growth-oriented individuals embrace feedback and criticism. While those with a fixed mindset might get defensive, those with a growth mindset use feedback and criticism to learn and grow their skills.

Don’t wait to get feedback: actively seek it out. Use feedback from credible sources like your manager, colleagues, even your customers to help you make improvements. Then, apply the information you’ve gained to cultivate and refine the skills and qualities you desire.

Fueling a growth mindset can help you achieve your goals and excel in your career. If you’re ready to put that growth mindset to work, check out the latest career opportunities at Beyondsoft.
