			Vietnam has a dense network of rivers with 2,360 rivers with a length of over 10 km, of which 109 are main rivers. There are 16 river basins nationwide with an area of ​​more than 2,500 square kilometers, 10/16 river basins with an area of ​​over 10,000 square kilometers. Total surface  water of river basins is about 830 - 840 billion m3/year, however, only about 37% is endogenous water, the remaining 63% is  water flowing from neighboring countries into Vietnam's territory. Due to the geographical location and specific natural conditions, about 60% of the water is concentrated in the Mekong River Basin, 16% in the Red River - Thai Binh Basin, about 4% in the Dong Nai River Basin. In other large river basins, the total amount of water accounts for the remaining part.

In recent years, the surface water environment of Vietnam has been contaminated in a variety of ways, and has even tended to increase in terms of area and level of pollution. However, pollution sources and the current state of the surface  water environment in each region differ depending on the specific natural conditions as well as the focus of socio-economic development in each region.

Perhaps many people still have not forgotten the oil contamination of the Da River in 2019, which seriously affected domestic  water sources in many places in Hanoi. Furthermore, the 2008 disaster along Thi Vai River (Dong Nai River) caused a large number of fish and shrimp deaths due to the discharge of the Vedan factory into the water environment.

According to Unicef, water pollution in Vietnam is in the TOP 5 countries with the highest amount of waste dumped into rivers and seas in the world, following China, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand.

In industrial zones, hundreds of large and small production units holding tons of untreated wastewater discharged straight into pipelines, organic pollutants, and metals remaining in  water have entered the  water source.

Domestic garbage is thrown around in cities, clogging sewers and preventing water from draining. As a result, whenever it rains, people must drain the water through the sewers. Because of waste, the water in the Nhue and To Lich rivers is black and smelly.

In rural areas, due to difficult living conditions and outdated facilities, untreated domestic and livestock wastes seeped into underground water sources. People who drink untreated groundwater are more likely to get diseases caused by contaminated water.

Besides, the overuse of fertilizers and plant protection substances in agricultural production leads to pollution of canals, rivers, lakes and severely affects human health.

According to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, around 9,000 people die in Vietnam each year as a result of poor  water supply and sanitation; nearly 200,000 new cancer cases are identified each year, with one of the main reasons being the usage of polluted  water.

In addition to surface water pollution, underground water sources in Vietnam are also heavily polluted. In some rural areas, groundwater contaminated with harmful microorganisms has exceeded the permissible limit. According to reports, underground water in some areas, including Bac Ninh, Ha Nam, and Nam Dinh has showed indicators of organic pollution (N03-, NH4+), heavy metals (Fe, As), and particularly dangerous microorganisms (Coliform, E, Coli). This is a threat not just to production operations, but also to people's health, because residents in this area use groundwater not only for agricultural production, but also for daily activities.

According to the assessment of the Ministry of Health and Agriculture and Rural Development:  Water sources are contaminated with bacteria, viruses, excess amounts of chemicals and heavy metals. If the   water is not treated well, it will be a major cause of water-related diseases when people use it for a long time. Malaria is one of the most frequent of these diseases, and it has a negative impact on human health. Cholera, typhoid, dysentery, hepatitis, polymyositis, skin and respiratory illnesses and even cancer are among the diseases that follow.
