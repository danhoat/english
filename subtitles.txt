What are you doing?
Oh, this is a $10,000 Versace.
I know, and I want to buy them.
Buy them?
Why?
What do you mean why?
I mean what do you need them for?
Is it for a gift?
Want to buy them for myself?
Do you have any problem with that?
No, no, no problem at all.
Great.
So maybe you just give me back the shoes I
want to look at?
No.
What do you mean now?
I mean that no one will help you in this
boutique.
We are an elite establishment and we serve respectable clients
who can appreciate our products physically.
What did you just say?
Listen, if you want to stay in the hallway, you
can do it as long as you want.
The door is open for you so you won't get
in any trouble when you drive away.
Are you out of your mind?
Customer support number and other salesman now.
Customer support number and other salesman now.
Do you hear me?
If you keep shouting like this, I will have to
call the security.
So one last time, no one can help you in
this establishment.
I can.
You're on an internship.
I don't care.
No, that's not going to happen.
Do you think that I'm going to leave it at
that?
Really.
Watch me smile, please.
If you won't serve me, I will put it on
the social media and I will tell every world that
you're humiliating people with disabilities here in your elite boutique.
This is just a misunderstanding.
No one here is trying to humiliate you.
If you want, our intern Helen will help you.
Helen.
How can I help you, Missus?
I'm sorry, Missus Clarice Henderson.
Missus Henderson, Are you interested in a specific brand or
do you want to create?
Great choice, Missus Henderson.
They are made for a pretty girl like you.
That was pretty girl 10 years ago.
If you're undecided, we can look at some similar models.
No, I'm a little bit in a hurry, so I
can go right now.
OK, then we'll just find your size.
Lady, can you check this?
Versace size 7.
Oops.
We don't have any sevens.
No way.
I saw them in the backroom yesterday.
I don't know.
I don't see anything.
But I need these exact shoes.
I need them.
Wait a second.
We have practically the same Versace from the same line,
only they are decommissioned, so you'll need to pay cash,
but they're more expensive.
You know, I don't have time.
Don't you worry.
I have them right here in the backroom, so just
a few minutes and you'll have your shoes in no
time.
All right, All right, but hurry up, please.
Missus Henderson, why don't you have some coffee while you
wait?
If it's won't take a lot of time, I would
have some.
Of course.
It'll be quick.
We have a coffee machine right behind our cash register.
Would you like an espresso?
Yeah, I would love some.
And no sugar, please.
Of course.
I'll be right back.
What are you going to say now, lady?
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
I.
Have you left a client alone on the floor?
Helen, are you out of your mind?
You know the rules.
You should never leave the floor.
There has to be always an assistant on the floor.
Go back in there right now.
Yes.
No, let me take the shoes right away to Missus
Henderson.
It's a defect, Yes.
So what?
What do you mean?
So what?
You can't do that.
Helen, sweetie, That woman is incredible.
She won't even feel a thing.
And besides, how can you miss an opportunity to earn
some extra money?
I never knew before that people like you put money
in their pockets instead of the cash register.
People like me.
Oh, honey, how about people like us?
Because, you know, she always say I can share.
I'm not like that.
Lydia, you'll have to explain everything to a manager tonight.
Stop.
No, Lydia, Why were you trying to sell this defective
product to our customer?
Oh, can I believe this?
Why did you try to sell this poor handicapped woman
this defective shoe if you glued them up?
Oh, Helen, that's so low.
I don't know what the bosses will say.
You.
That's a lie.
Yeah, it is.
But you, honey, are an intern, and I've worked here
for five years.
So who do you think they're going to believe?
What took you so long?
I'm sorry, I didn't realize issues were so far in
the back.
OK, how much?
Just a second.
I'm checking the final price.
OK, where is the moment?
Let's try them on while Lady I ring them up.
They're defective.
She's trying to cheat you.
What?
I'm sorry.
Defective.
You'll be cheated.
Defective.
She wants to cheat me.
Oh, Helen, what the hell is going on here?
You've spent a lot of my precious time.
Are you out of your mind?
That's it, sweetie.
Your game is over.
Remember what we talked about in the backroom?
Your fire, Your internship is over.
Very well.
What a nice shoes.
Ma'am.
What?
What?
Ma'am, What?
What are you doing?
Oh, oops.
Oh, just as I thought.
That's just a mistake.
I can't explain.
Stop.
Blind.
Lydia Carter.
I'm from corporate.
Yes, and you had an undercover client today, and I'm
here to pretend a woman in a wheelchair for her.
I've stopped.
You'll have a warning anyway.
That is the first.
But this thing with the heel, it's too much.
So you're fired, sweetie.
No, no.
You may go now.
Also, our lawyers will contact you for the reputational damage
you've done to accompany.
See you in a court.
You may go now.
How did you guess about the heel?
Oh, dear.
I've been working in this business for so many years.
You did a great job today.
Thank you for that.
And I think that it would be fair, like starting
from tomorrow, you will be the one in charge of
the store.
But I'm just minting here.
You can handle it.
You know, you have something that other people don't.
You were not shy of me today.
A woman in a wheelchair and you risky job.
You're a very good person.
You know, the people like you are keeping the world
turning.
Thank you.
