		Dear James, <br />

As you know, we have been working on the new perfume that we are launching in April and we are unsure about some of the packaging details.<br /> We have seen some of your creative work in the sales department and we think you have a very good eye for detail.

 <br />
Do you have some time before close of business this Friday to sit down with us and talk through some of our designs? <br />We would truly appreciate your advice on this. It shouldn't take longer than two hours of your time and we would be happy to clear it with Patricia, your department head, if necessary.
 <br />

	Interviewer: Marcin, what do you do?
Marcin: I’m a student, and I’m also a waiter in a restaurant.
Interviewer: You study and work.
Marcin: Yes, but I don’t work every day.
Interviewer: I see ...
Marcin: I work in the restaurant on Monday evening. On Tuesday I study computers at university. My class is in the afternoon. My course is fun – I love it. Wednesday is my day off. I don’t go to work, and I don’t go to university. I stay at home all day. It’s great – me, the TV and my computer! On Thursday I study again, my class is at nine in the morning, then I study in the afternoon. On Friday I go to the supermarket.
