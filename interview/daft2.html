About me
Hello, my name is Pippa. I am a qualified English and experienced English teacher from Oxford, England. I have travelled to many places and I enjoy meeting a wide range of people from all over the world. I have over 10 years of experience working as a 1:1 support work counselor, administrator and manager with both children and adults in various charities in the UK. I spend a lot of time enjoying nature and walking dogs and I am interested in many different types of music and love to dance. I regularly do yoga and meditation which helps me maintain a healthy lifestyle.


I qualified in Teaching English as a Foreign Language 2 years ago, following 6 months of study. I have lots of experience throughout my career of working with people from different backgrounds with a variety of native languages and enjoy sharing knowledge and supporting other people to reach their goals. I have a 1st class honours degree (BSc) in Combined Social Sciences from Cardiff University. I am trained in motivational interviewing, child protection, homelessness and substance misuse among a number of other things.

My experience and personality make my approach to teaching conversational, relaxed and patient, whilst always trying to ensure my students are happy and learning to the best of their ability. I can adapt lessons to meet your interests and needs. I have a conversational style to teaching and am open to students finding topics which interest them as well as having some pre-structured lesson plans to refer to if needed. I have a variety of teaching specialties due to my wide-ranging background and experience of working with people in various sectors. As a native English speaker I am confident supporting with accent coaching, discussing current events, idioms and slang as well as friendly conversation. I also used to work in careers guidance and advice so can help with things like CV writing, university applications and writing emails.


I hope you would like to try a trial lesson with me so that we can get to know each other, your goals and we can come up with ideas to help you achieve them. I will ensure you are comfortable and leave your first lesson looking forward to furthering your English.
